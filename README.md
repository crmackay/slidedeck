### [Take a look at these slides!](http://rawgit.com/rmcgibbo/slidedeck-example/master/index.html)


Overview
========

This is a repackaging of the google io 2012 slidedeck, with [these](https://github.com/francescolaffi/elastic-google-io-slides) modifications, to be a little easier to use and more suitable for scientific presentations.

We've made a few changes:

- You edit and author your entire presentation in markdown.
- All the metadata about your project is set within the markdown file, including things like
  the title and author.
- It's packaged as a python project.
    - You run `slidedeck create` to make a new deck. This will create a new directory with your
      project. In particular, there will be a fine in there called `slides.md` that contains the
      markdown source for your slides.
    - `slidedeck render` will render your deck from markdown to html5.
    - `slidedeck watch` will watch your project and rerender the slides whenever you change the
       content (useful for iterative development).
- I made a few stylistic changes to the css, including changing the font size.
- The slides can contain LaTeX, which is rendered via mathjax.
- There are no google logos all over the place


Getting started
===============
Install the package. This will add the command line program `slidedeck` to your PATH.
```
python setup.py install
```

Create a new project, complete with some template slides, the css, and the javascript.
```
slidedeck create my_slides
```

Look in there for the `slides.md` file, and edit it to your liking. When you want to see
your work, compile the slides from markdown into HTML.
```
slidedeck render
```

You can also have the HTML *auto-compiled* from markdown, any time the files change on disk.
```
slidedeck watch
```

If you're curious about how any of these commands work, pass the `-h` flag to the command
line executable,

```
slidedeck -h
slidedeck create -h
```

Tricks
======

`slidedeck watch` works nicely with the [tincr](http://tin.cr/) extension for
chrome, which will refresh your browser every time the html files its serving
are changed on disk.

Dependencies
============

You will need a modern python installation (tested on 2.7) with
`jinja2` and `markdown` installed. To use the `slidedeck watch` command,
you'll also need `watchdog` installed.

You can get these packages with the `easy_install` or `pip` package managers
by running

```
sudo easy_install jinja2 markdown watchdog
```

or

```
sudo pip install jinja2 markdown watchdog
```
